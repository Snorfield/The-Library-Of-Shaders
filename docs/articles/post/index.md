# Post Processing Shaders

Post processing shaders are, well, they are what they sound like. These shaders run after, or post, processing happens. 

Instead of affecting how objects are drawn, they can apply final visual effects, before the user sees the frame.

Post processing effects can include:

- Bloom
- Motion Blur
- Sharpening
- Chromatic Aberration

and a lot of other very cool stuff.
