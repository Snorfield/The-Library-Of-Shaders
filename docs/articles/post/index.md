# Post Processing Shaders

Post processing shaders are what they sound like. These shaders run after (post-) processing happens. 

Instead of affecting how objects are drawn, they can apply final visual effects, before the user sees the frame.

Post processing effects can include:

- Bloom
- Motion Blur
- Sharpening
- Chromatic Aberration

and a lot of other very cool stuff.
